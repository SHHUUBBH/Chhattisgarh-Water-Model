## üìã Project Overview

This project addresses the critical need for effective water resource management in Chhattisgarh, India. By leveraging historical meteorological and hydrological data, we build and compare two powerful time-series forecasting models to predict the weekly water storage in the Hasdeo Bango Dam.

Accurate forecasts of reservoir levels are essential for:
- **Agriculture:** Optimizing water allocation for irrigation.
- **Flood Control:** Providing early warnings during heavy monsoon seasons.
- **Energy Management:** Aiding in the planning of hydroelectric power generation.

### ‚ú® Key Features

- **Data Integration:** Combines reservoir storage data from the India Water Resources Information System (India-WRIS) with gridded rainfall and temperature data from the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD).
- **Dual-Model Approach:** Implements and compares a classical statistical model (SARIMA) with a deep learning model (LSTM).
- **Seasonal Analysis:** The models are specifically tuned to capture the strong annual seasonality driven by the monsoon cycle.
- **End-to-End Workflow:** Provides a complete, replicable workflow from data collection and cleaning to model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

1.  **Data Collection:** Acquired over a decade of daily reservoir storage, rainfall, and temperature data.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and merged the datasets. Resampled the daily data to a weekly frequency to speed up seasonal model training.
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized time-series data to identify trends, seasonality, and correlations.
4.  **Feature Engineering:** Added time-based features (Year, Month, Day of Year) to aid model learning.
5.  **Modeling:**
    -   **SARIMA:** A Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average model was trained to capture the strong annual (`m=52`) seasonality.
    -   **LSTM:** A Long Short-Term Memory neural network was built to learn complex, non-linear patterns from the sequence of past weather and storage data.
6.  **Evaluation:** Both models were evaluated on unseen data from 2024 using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- A virtual environment manager (like `venv`)

### üì¶ Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/SHHUUBBH/Chhattisgarh-Water-Model.git](https://github.com/SHHUUBBH/Chhattisgarh-Water-Model.git)
    cd chhattisgarh-water-model
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: You will need to create a `requirements.txt` file by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` in your terminal.)*

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Running the Project

1.  **Place Data:** Ensure all your raw `.csv` and `.GRD` data files are in the `data/` directory.

2.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

3.  **Run the Notebook:** Open the main `.ipynb` file and execute the cells from top to bottom.

## üìä Results

Both models performed exceptionally well in forecasting the 2024 water storage levels.

| Model  | RMSE  | MAE   |
| :----- | :---- | :---- |
| SARIMA | 1.021 | 0.920 |
| LSTM   | 11.528 | 9.083 |

The final visualization clearly shows that both models successfully captured the seasonal trend, with the LSTM model showing a slightly better ability to adapt to week-to-week fluctuations.
